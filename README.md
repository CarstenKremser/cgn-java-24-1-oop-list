# Exercise: 2-Object Orientation/6-List


## Coding: Students in List

Create a new project in IntelliJ and lay the foundation for the Java List project.

* Step 1: Create a Java class "Student" that should have the following properties: First name, Last name, Student ID.
* Step 2: Create a Java List for elements of type "Student" and add multiple students.

## Coding: School

Abstraction using object-oriented techniques.

* Step 3: Create a class "School" to which students can be added through a method ('addStudent').
* Step 4: Implement a method to print all students of the school (as text, to the console).

## Coding: Searching and Deleting

Algorithms with lists.

* Step 5: Add a method to find a student by their ID. The found student should be returned.
* Step 6: Create a method to remove a student from the school.
* If you have already completed this task earlier, you may work on the bonus task on the next page.

## Bonus: Course

If you have already completed the main task, you can try this bonus task.

* Expand the Java-List project with a class called "Course" that has the following properties: course name, instructor, room.
* Add a method to the Student class to add courses to the student (courses in which the student is participating).
* Implement a method within the School class to retrieve all courses of a specific student (based on a student ID).

## Bonus: Sack

Are you so fast?

* Write a class 'Sack' that functions like an ArrayList. It can only use primitive data types and arrays.
* Implement step by step the methods add, get, size, remove last, remove by index, and so on.
* Tip: Maybe this video can help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wynYYts1uS0

## Bonus: Beutel

Are you so fast???

* Write a class 'Beutel' that functions like the 'Sack', but only uses primitive data types (no arrays!!!).
* Again, implement step by step the methods add, get, size, remove last, remove by index, and so on.
* There is also a video tip for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Mqs8nS6Mk
